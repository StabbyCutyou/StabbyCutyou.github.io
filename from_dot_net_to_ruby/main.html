              <h2>Before coming to Ruby...</h2>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">This one might be the most divisive</p>
            </section>
            <section>
               <h2>The (not so) poignent guide to Ruby</h2>
               <p class="fragment fade-in visible">I wanted to learn Ruby, not the depths to which madness can drive a person</p>
               <p class="fragment fade-in visible">(But, it probably wasn't aimed at a person like me)</p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h2>Once I started writing Ruby...</h2>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">Let's get the obvious ones out of the way</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">It's slow!</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">Modules are weird!</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">Bundler keeps doing a thing I don't understand!</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">Rspec doesn't make sense!</p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h2>Parentheses</h2>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">Sometimes you use them, sometimes you don't</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">"Am I calling a property or a method?!"</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">It makes code ambiguous, difficult to read</p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h2>No Interfaces</h2>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">My life in .NET was nothing but interfaces</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">Testing was especially impossible without them</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">"But how do I KNOW the method is available to be called?!"</p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h2>No privacy, no hiding anything</h2>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">Someone made something private?<br/>Nice Try : #send</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">"Private" instance variable?<br/>Think again : #instance_variable_get/set</p>

            <section>
              <h2>Meta Magic</h2>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">Nothing is ever as it seems</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">Think you're calling a method?<br/>Nope : Aliasing!</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">Going to lookup a method definition?<br/>Try again : Dynamically created at run time!</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">Think you can only call methods that were actually defined in some way?<br/>Swing and a miss : Method Missing!<p>

              <h2>Prerequisite whining about things in Rails</h2>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">No set of complaints is complete without it</p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h2>No "Service" pattern for business logic</h2>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">Fat Controllers is bad design</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">Fat Models are ALSO bad design</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">Keeping business logic in "Service" objects does not make you "too enterprisey"</p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h2>Active Record Models</h2>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">What properties does this model have?</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">Don't bother trying to read the model itself</p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h2>No real support for custom SQL reports</h2>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">Yes, you can execute arbitrary SQL</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">Yes, you can use AREL to build queries</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">But being able to hand-write reports where it matters easily is important</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">And AREL is no better than any other SQL building DSL. They're all subpar compared to the real thing</p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h2>But, it wasn't all bad</h2>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">I don't have to worry as much about types</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">Blocks are pretty sweet</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">The functional-ish side of Ruby is pretty cool</p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h2>I actually love a lot of this stuff now</h2>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">It just took some getting used to programming without a net</p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h2>RSpec</h2>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">I didn't like it first, but eventually grew to appreciate what it was doing</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">Context-driven organization for tests makes sense</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">It's not perfect, but no testing library is</p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h2>Meta Magic is great, when used with care</h2>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">If I had to write a DSL, I'd choose ruby</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">When you have to, it's great for hotfixing problems</p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h2>Just because Rails doesn't, doesn't mean I can't</h2>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">I use app/services and you can't stop me</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">Turbolinks has an off button for a reason</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">And Rails is pretty good for most things in general</p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h2>I still don't care for ActiveRecord</h2>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">But, it's ubiquitous and works fine ~80% of the time</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">I can brute force my way around most of the parts I disagree with if I have to</p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h2>In closing</h2>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">Programming languages are different</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">It's ok not to like stuff, even stuff other people say you should like</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-in visible">Things you hate today, could be things you love tomorrow</p>
